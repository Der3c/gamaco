Blog Post #1
I started blogging back in the days of Xanga. I know that probably dates me a bit. However, since that time, Ive been more busy doing than writing. Seven cities, 6 houses, 3 kids, and multiple promotions later I find myself wanting to focus more on my creative bent and take some time to reflect. Thats what this blog is about, my adventures in creating, exploring, and growing in the field of development. You’re welcome to come along and I hope that this blog is inspirational and informative.

Today I was complimented by one of the more senior members of my company for being a “man of action!’ Its a deeply held belief of mine that for the most part it is much better to just start doing, and course correct on the way as you learn. Just. Start. Doing.

One of the most impactful business books that I have read in a long time is Rework by the guys that brought us Ruby, Jason Fried and David Hansson. It is a phenomenal book about productivity, and Just. Getting. Started.

That is what I am doing with this blog and with learning to develop. Moving in the direction of my goals.
